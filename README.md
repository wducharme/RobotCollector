## Info
Robot Collector is a game about creating as many robots and collecting as many coins as possible
1. Create robots for 100 coins each
2. Assign tasks to robots to earn coins and create more robots
3. Keep track of your most productive robots with the built-in leaderboard


## Special Code Features
1. Includes a class/object oriented design with Robot and Task objects
2. Utilizes multithreading to keep track of task progress for each robot


## Special notes
1. Currently my code does not account for all user input edge cases (if you follow the instructions onscreen and enter valid input everything should work fine)
2. If the current main menu does not reflect your current robot count or coin count, reload the main menu with option 5
